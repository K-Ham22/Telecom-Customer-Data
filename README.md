●	Utilized Python and Juptyer Notebooks to conduct a series of analyses with these libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Math, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingno, Datetime, Statsmodels, and Sci-kit Learn. 
●	Acquired data from the telecommunications customer database using SQL. Joined 5 tables and used a CTE to select relevant variables. Imported this dataset into Python for cleaning and analysis.
●	Data cleaning: removed duplicates, missing values analysis, imputed missing and null values, data types, removed outliers, consistent variable names.
●	Statistical analysis: conducted a two-sample t-test to determine if customers who churn have a different mean monthly charge than customers who do not churn. Determined that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean monthly charge. 
●	Regression analysis: Created both a linear regression model and a logistic regression model to determine what factors predict how much data per year a customer uses on average and to determine what factors influence customer churn. 
●	Provided technical insights on how the company can reduce customer churn by focusing on the variables that most influence churn, namely contract type.
